# ML-Poker-Hand-Detector

### Realtime poker hand detector made using PyTorch and [Ultralytics' yolov5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5), trained with this [playing card dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/andy8744/playing-cards-object-detection-dataset) made by Andy8744.

To use this you will need to download the [custom weights I trained](https://www.dropbox.com/s/213hqltoj1c4om2/cards_v5.pt?dl=0), put them in the main folder and then run detect_poker_hand.py with whatever source you wish to use.
